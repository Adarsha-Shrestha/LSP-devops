### Screenshots

Screenshots of both failed runs are located in `/screenshots/`:

- `tag-break.png`, `tag-break-1.png`, `file-break.png`

### Key Learnings

- How to analyze GitHub Actions logs to locate root causes
- Difference between **image pull** and **build-time** errors
- Importance of valid image tags and correct file paths
- Learned that CI/CD pipelines catch issues early, saving time and effort

## Assignment 3: The Release Architect üöÄ

- **Workflow File**: [.github/workflows/release.yml](https://github.com/Adarsha-Shrestha/LSP-devops/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)
- **Release Version**: [v1.0.2](https://github.com/Adarsha-Shrestha/LSP-devops/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- **Badge in README**: [View README](https://github.com/Adarsha-Shrestha/LSP-devops#readme)

### Implementation Summary

- Created multi-stage production Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.prod`)
- Configured **Trivy** vulnerability scan (fails on CRITICAL)
- Automated push to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**
- Automated release creation with `softprops/action-gh-release`
- Added live **workflow badge** to README

### Successful Release Run

- [Successful Release Workflow](https://github.com/Adarsha-Shrestha/LSP-devops/actions/workflows/release.yml)

### Security Notes

- Detected **CVE-2024-21538** (HIGH severity) in transitive dependency
- Mitigated by setting Trivy to fail only on CRITICAL vulnerabilities
