## üß† Research Summary

### 1. Git Tags & Semantic Versioning

- Tags like `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0-beta` identify **stable** and **pre-release** versions.
- Semantic Versioning follows:  
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - **MAJOR** ‚Äì breaking changes
  - **MINOR** ‚Äì new features
  - **PATCH** ‚Äì small fixes

### 2. Automated Releases

- The workflow uses [softprops/action-gh-release](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release) to automatically:
  - Create GitHub Releases using tag names.
  - Generate changelogs.
  - Attach relevant build artifacts.

### 3. Security Scanning with Trivy

- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) scans Docker images for known vulnerabilities.
- Configured to **fail pipeline if any CRITICAL vulnerabilities** are found.
